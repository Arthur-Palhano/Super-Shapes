<h3>I used P5.js to simulate a supershape according to a certain value M</h3>

**If you don't know what is a supershape, I'll explain for you :)**

Supershape is a graphic projection of a kind of parametric equation that simulates cool shapes in a 2d plane.

**My code is inspired by David Shiffman's project.**
